# TimeSheet
I would recommend that you use the timesheet in order to be linked with everyone but the whatapps group should be only be helpfully for communication. 
The Time Sheet should give you an idea of when you arrive what you should do. Sign in is good for the manager to know that he can trust you with the work that is there. 
Without this what will the boss think..
